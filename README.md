# List of my Presentations, Posters, and other fun things

Since I believe in open science and accessible research, I'll try to make all presentations, posters, tutorials, and other fun things from my PhD public through this (or a designated) repository.
Preliminary work might be removed from the documents, so some presentations might appear incomplete.

If you want to use parts of my work in one of your presentations, please cite me and include a link to [my webpage](https://www.annalenakofler.com).

If you have any questions about the materials, want to chat or invite me for a talk, please don't hesitate reach out via email!

![Poster with two illustrated black holes in the center. It explains what gravitational waves are and how parameter estimation can be performed with DINGO. The standard DINGO architecture with a Resnet and normalizing flow is illustrated and compared to the DINGO-T1 architecture, consisting of a transformer encoder and a normalizing flow. The flexibility of the transformer is used to perform data analysis on 48 GW events with 17 different data analysis settings. Results are validated with importance sampling. ](2025/20251203_poster_DINGO-T1.png)

The folder [`memes_and_other_fun`](https://github.com/annalena-k/presentations-posters-and-other-fun-things/tree/main/memes_and_other_fun) contains amazing memes by other people that I found funny and wanted to keep track of for future presentations. I hope they make you laugh!
