# List of my Presentations, Posters, and other fun things

Since I believe in open science and accessible research, I'll try to make all presentations, posters, tutorials, and other fun things from my PhD public through this (or a designated) repository.
Preliminary work might be removed from the documents, so some presentations might appear incomplete.

If you want to use parts of my work in one of your presentations, please cite me and include a link to [my webpage](https://www.annalenakofler.com).

If you have any questions about the materials, want to chat or invite me for a talk, please don't hesitate reach out via email!

The folder [`memes_and_other_fun`](https://github.com/annalena-k/presentations-posters-and-other-fun-things/tree/main/memes_and_other_fun) contains amazing memes by other people that I found funny and wanted to keep track of for future presentations. I hope they make you laugh!
